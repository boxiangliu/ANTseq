## Nomenclature: 
AFR_AMR_EUR contains primers for AIMs selected to distinguish African, Native American, and European populations.
five_way contains primers to distinguish five major continental populations.
pairwise contains primers to distinguish pairs of populations. For examples, AFR.EUR/ contains primers to distinguish Africans and Europeans.

## Population Abbreviations: 
AFR = African 
AMR = Native American
EAS = East Asian
EUR = European
SAS = South Asian

## Columns: 
snp = SNP ID by chr_position  
forward = forward primer
fwd_tmp = forward primer Tm
reverse = reverse primer
rev_tmp = reverse primer Tm
range = chr:start-end
fwd_id = forward primer ID
fwd_adaptor = forward primer with adaptor (GCGTTATCGAGGTC)
rev_id = reverse primer ID
rev_adaptor = reverse primer with adaptor (GTGCTCTTCCGATCT)
